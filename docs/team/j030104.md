## Overview

KitchenCTRL is a Java-based command-line application for managing kitchen inventory and recipes. It supports inventory tracking, recipe storage, and provides a simple text interface optimized for usability and modular design.

Given below are my contributions to the project:

## Summary of Contributions

* **Feature Implementation**: `CatalogueContentManager`
    * *What it does*: Handles all loading and saving operations for the Inventory and RecipeBook catalogues, converting between structured text and in-memory objects.
    * *Justification*: Since Inventory and RecipeBook use different text formats, a unified loading method would have led to error-prone code. I implemented separate parsing logic to ensure correctness and clarity.
    * *Highlights*: I abstracted the save logic into a single method by leveraging Java's polymorphism. Each catalogue class to be saved is supposed to have `getCatalogueContent()` to define its own serialization format, adhering to **encapsulation** and the **Single Responsibility Principle**.

* **Testing & Debugging**:
    * *JUnit tests written*: `StorageTest.java` — extensively tested inventory and recipe file handling, including edge cases such as empty files and malformed entries.
    * *Bug Fixes*: Fixed multiple issues in `ParserTest.java` and `UiTest.java`, especially in `testWelcomeCommand_inventory` and `testWelcomeCommand_recipe`, where the debug output was misleading and required deep inspection of program state and test execution order.

* **Code Quality Enhancements**:
    * Replaced non-standard characters (e.g., →) in documentation with more portable alternatives like `->` to ensure better cross-platform compatibility and readability.
    * Adhered to Checkstyle and JavaDoc standards for all additions and modifications.

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Fixed the markdown structure and did some updates.
    * Developer Guide:
        * Documented the architecture behind `CatalogueContentManager`.
    * PPP:
        * Explained the different handling of Inventory and RecipeBook due to their text format differences.

* **Pull Requests & Code Reviews**:
    * Pull Request [\#60](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T13-1/tp/pull/60): Fixed test files' bugs and resolved inconsistencies in command parsing tests.
    * Participated in reviews by identifying platform portability issues and proposing cleanup patches.
